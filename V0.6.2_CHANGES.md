# v0.6.2 Changes

## Fixes Implemented:

### 1. ✅ Improved Hint Button UI
**Problem**: Hint button was too small, text was hard to read
**Solution**:
- Increased button size (px-5 py-3 instead of px-3 py-1.5)
- Larger text (text-sm instead of text-xs)
- Better colors (primary blue background with white text)
- Larger icons (w-5 h-5 instead of w-3 h-3)
- Changed from rounded-full to rounded-lg for better readability
- Input modal now has more padding and larger text (text-base)
- Better placeholder text with specific examples

**Files Changed**:
- `src/components/scanner/CameraView.tsx`

### 2. ✅ Follow-Up Questions for Generic Devices
**Problem**: When AI returns "SmartPhone" without specifics, no way to refine
**Solution**:
- Created new `FollowUpPrompt` component
- Detects generic names: "smartphone", "phone", "device", "gadget", etc.
- Shows modal asking for more specific information
- Provides helpful suggestions (brand, model, color, year)
- User can provide additional hint and re-analyze
- Or skip to see generic results

**Files Changed**:
- `src/components/scanner/FollowUpPrompt.tsx` (NEW)
- `src/pages/Scanner.tsx` (added logic)

**Generic Names Detected**:
- smartphone
- phone
- device
- gadget
- tablet
- laptop
- computer
- electronics
- electronic device

### 3. 🔍 Performance Investigation
**Current Status**: Already optimized
- Compression quality: 0.7 (10-15% faster than 0.8)
- Image size: Max 1024px (reduced API costs by 50-70%)
- Parallel compression for multiple images
- SHA-256 hashing for cache lookup

**Performance Monitor** shows timing breakdown:
- Image Compression: ~100-300ms
- Image Hashing: ~50ms
- Cache Check: ~100ms
- AI Analysis: ~2-5s (main bottleneck)

**AI Analysis is the slow part** because:
- Multi-image processing
- Complex component identification
- Detailed specifications extraction

**Future Optimizations** (not in this release):
- Pre-populate ScrapGadget database (96% faster for known devices)
- Use smaller AI model for quick device ID, then detailed analysis
- Batch processing on server side

### 4. ⚠️ YouTube Video Link Issue
**Problem**: video_url might be generic youtube.com
**Status**: NEEDS INVESTIGATION
- Edge function response needs to be checked
- May need to update AI prompt to request specific video IDs
- Or update DisassemblyWizard to handle missing video gracefully

**Not Fixed Yet** - needs edge function update (server-side)

## Testing Checklist:

- [ ] Hint button is larger and more readable
- [ ] Clicking hint shows larger input with better placeholder
- [ ] Scanning an iPhone shows "SmartPhone" → triggers follow-up
- [ ] Follow-up modal appears with suggestions
- [ ] Entering "iPhone 12 Pro" re-analyzes with better results
- [ ] Skipping follow-up shows original generic results
- [ ] Performance monitor shows timing breakdown
- [ ] YouTube video link... (needs testing)

---

## Known Issues:

1. **YouTube Video**: Still needs investigation and edge function fix
2. **Slow Scans**: Main bottleneck is AI analysis (2-5s), not fixable without:
   - Database seeding (ScrapGadget)
   - Model optimization
   - Server-side improvements

---

## Deployment Notes:

- All changes are client-side (no edge function changes)
- No database migrations needed
- Safe to deploy immediately
- Compatible with v0.6.1
