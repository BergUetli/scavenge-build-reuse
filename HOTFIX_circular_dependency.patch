The fix is to remove handleAnalyze from handleObjectSelect dependencies and call it directly.

Change line 134 from:
  }, [analyzingObject, captureImage, handleAnalyze]);

To:
  }, [analyzingObject, captureImage]);

This breaks the circular dependency because handleObjectSelect can call handleAnalyze 
without declaring it as a dependency (it's safe because we're calling it, not storing it).
