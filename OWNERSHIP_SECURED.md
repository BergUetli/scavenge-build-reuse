## 💬 **FAQ**

### **Q: Can Lovable claim any rights to my code?**
**A**: No. You own the GitHub repo, and you've made substantial modifications. The template they provided is standard boilerplate (not proprietary). Your custom features are 100% yours.

### **Q: Can I use this commercially?**
**A**: Yes! MIT License allows full commercial use without restrictions.

### **Q: Do I need to give Lovable credit?**
**A**: You've acknowledged them in ATTRIBUTION.md (good practice), but MIT License doesn't require attribution for your modifications.

### **Q: What if I want to sell this?**
**A**: You can! You own it. Buyer gets the MIT License too.

### **Q: Can I change the license later?**
**A**: Yes, you're the copyright holder. You can relicense as you wish.

### **Q: Should I create a new "scavy" organization?**
**A**: Not necessary. Your current setup is fine. Only create an org if you want team collaboration or branding separation.
